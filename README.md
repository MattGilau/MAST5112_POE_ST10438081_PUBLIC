-- PART 2 Feedback --

The feedback I received from Part 2 was mostly positive, however, I was warned about my use of color and that my added items were not displayed on the Home Screen ###once they were added. These issues are addressed below.

-- User Interface Updates --

In order to ensure that the UI is more user-friendly, I changed the color of certain aspects to ensure better uniformity and to guarantee the user does not get confused by to many different colors and information on screen. I did this by changing:
Initial Home Screen: 

- The total price containers were changed to a lighter blue to complement, yet keep clarity, the darker blue used in the menu item containers.
- The view menu, calculate total, and login buttons were changed to green which, although they have different functions, ensures the user can more easily identify them as buttons that perform progressive actions such as calculating something or going to a new screen.
- The "clear selections" button was changed to red to indicate it performs a regressive action that clears all the selections made.
- 
Login Screen:

- The Login button was changed to green while the back button was made red to ensure uniformity across all screens.
  
Buttons and headings:

- The button colors and headings were kept uniform across all screens.

-- New Screens & Functionality --

I failed to figure out how to get the new menu items that were added/removed to display on the home screen from Part 2. This was also a result of me using images for each menu item on the original home screen as I didn't know how to incorporate that functionality with items the user adds. Furthermore, I could not get the items added to the array to be displayed in a drop-down menu. 
Subsequently, to work around the problem I added two new screens that would function as a filter screen and Home screen that functions according to the POE requirements. Additionally, I changed the Edit Menu Screen to have a simpler user interface that also validates certain inputs and checks the fields for emptiness. The two new screens also have simpler designs, prioritizing functionality over complex UI design. They allow the user to add and remove items, with these changes being updated on both the new filter and home screens.
